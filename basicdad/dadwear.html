        <h2>Common Tops-</h2><br>
        - T-Shirt- With bands, logos, or with “funny” message on them.
        Most people have a novelty t-shirt or two in their closet, but the Basic Dad has ones that are just
        outdated enough not to be trendy or cool. Doesn't matter to this guy. He will wear them in a completely
        non-ironic way.
        Odds are, a Basic Dad probably has a Big Dog or Panama Jack shirt somewhere in his closet.<br><br>
        To go with that…. There's rarely a circumstance where a Basic Dad won't have his shirt tucked into their
        pants, even if it's a tanktop, sweater, button-up, Polo, Halloween costume, or whatever. A Basic Dad has
        gotta
        tuck.<br><br>
        - Oddly Buttoned Shirts- often “Hawaiian tourist” or floral print shirts<br>
        If a Basic Dad is wearing a shirt with buttons on it, he isn't going to play by your rules. He's
        either going to have way too many buttons done or far from enough, like Tom Selleck from Magnum PI.
        It's all or nothing with buttons. All torso, or no torso whatsoever.<br><br>

        <h2>Common Bottoms-</h2><br>

        - Jorts or Cargo Shorts- Often with excessive pockets
        If there's one thing Basic Dads have in common with John Cena, it's the love of jean shorts. Which
        honestly doesn't make a lot of sense. Denim doesn't breathe well at all, so if it's hot enough to wear
        shorts,
        wouldn't you want maximum comfort? Basic Dads do not have time to listen to your logic and reasoning.<br>

        <h2>Shoes/Footwear</h2><br>
        - White New Balance Sneakers- (possibly slightly tinted green from grass stains)
        These are a staple in every Basic Dad’s wardrobe. They're perfect for business, pleasure, or the
        casual 3 on 3 pick-up game.<br><br>
        - Sandals- (with socks)
        Basic Dads have to keep it classy. That's why they keep those trademark dress socks on even when wearing
        the most casual of shoes. It's a lethal combination.<br><br>
        - Tube socks- pulled all the way up
        Not only is it a bizarre fashion choice to wear those long, black socks with a pair of shorts, it
        also kind of defeats the purpose of wearing shorts when your socks cover as much leg as a
        pair of jeans. This is a non-issue for the Basic Dad<br><br>
        
        <h2>Accessories</h2><br>
        - Braided Belts-
        Pants or Shorts are always belted. Often with this leather wicker style belt
        Some think belts are used to hold up your pants, but not the Basic Dad. Basic Dads will make room for a belt
        even if his jeans are too small. It's more about just knowing that leather is wrapped around his
        waist than it is for any practical reasons. If he could wear a belt with swim trunks, he would be
        all over it.<br><br>
        -Transition Lenses-
        Most conversations with a Basic Dad reach a point to where you're only talking about how long it took you
        to drive from one point to another. That's because Basic Dads love saving time. So it's only natural that
        dads don't have time to switch from glasses to sunglasses. Transition lenses are a dad dream come
        true. (Oversized or Aviator sunglasses will also work in a pinch)<br><br>
        - Baseball hat or Wide-Brimmed hat – Usually sporting logo of some sort.
        It doesn’t matter if it “goes” with the style or not, Basic Dads have to rock a hat. The bigger brimmed the
        better. That's why they
        insist on wearing hats in the style of Smalls from The Sandlot on every family outing.<br><br>
        - Fanny Packs-
        Let's face it sometimes a "normal" amount of pockets just aren't enough. Fanny packs are functional and
        cool.
        In the mind of the Basic Dad, he's looking tough while holding his stuff.<br><br>
        - Belt cell phone caddy or belt clip with phone attached-
        You know how you're constantly looking for your cell phone because you can't remember where you left
        it? Basic Dads have solved that problem by keeping it holstered directly to their hips at all times.
        It might not be pretty, but it gets the job done.<br><br>
        - Overly bloated wallet-
        A Basic Dad saves those coupons, punch-cards, and old receipts; creating quite the heavy
        brick in that back pocket. (Good thing hes got that belt to keep those pants held up)
        A Basic Dad has got to be prepared. You never know when those punch-cards and coupons might save a few cents
        here and there.<br><br>
        - Wife’s purse or A diaper bag-
        Though not always the case, Basic Dads can frequently be seen holding one of these in public. Most
        commonly seen outside of the dressing room when they go shopping with their wife.<br><br>
        - Fancy Key Chain
        Could be a hand-made gift from a child, a pinecone, or some other trinket. Or maybe a souvenir from
        a previous family vacation. But Basic Dads got to have a little bit of “dad bling” to show they’re a
        #1 dad.<br><br>
