        <h3>1. Dad Jokes- Dad jokes are usually puns, or one-liners. Dad jokes are considered to be lame by most
            comedic
            standards. With the exception of maybe, other dads or real little kids. Don’t expect to get a standing
            ovation for these. However, it doesn’t matter. They are still funny to the basic dad. Dad jokes often
            get
            told and retold every time the occasion for one may arise.</h3><br>

            2. Unfinished Home Improvements- Home improvements are an ongoing thing. Often times the basic dad has
            several “projects” he is working on.
            They may not ever be fully completed, and they may not be done perfectly. But the basic dad is a DIY
            guy. He’s always working on something.<br><br><br>
            3. Lawn Care- The basic dad knows the ins and outs of lawn care. Keeping that lawn looking green is very
            important. He knows the best times to water, when to fertilize and when to aerate. In relation, basic dads
            are
            often very concerned about which mower and trimmer to use. What works the best to meet the needs of
            their
            lawn.

            4. The Thermostat- Don’t touch that thermostat, unless you want an angry lecture about it from your
            basic dad.
            The basic dad KNOWS what the optimum temperature for the house should be. And where the thermostat
            should be set at during any season.
            He knows how to keep the house at just the right temp and still keep his energy bill low.<br><br>

            5. Naps- Napping is often, an unappreciated art. Basic dads love their naps, but will often deny every
            being asleep if caught.
            Basic dads can fall asleep almost anywhere, anytime and in the most awkward places. Whether due to the
            physiological change of becoming older,
            or just because basic dads are often busy and thus low on sleep; it isn’t clear. But basic dads love
            “resting their eyes”.<br><br>

            <h3>6. Barbecue- Basic dads have their barbecue game on point. Whether it be burgers
                and hotdogs, or steaks (really any grilled meats).They are masters of the grill for any occasion.
                It does not matter the conditions, basic dads will barbecue in the sweltering summer heat or in the cold of a bitter wintery storm.</h3>

            7. Gas Prices- A somewhat controversial topic, especially in our current situation, a basic dad is very
            concerned about saving a few cents on gas. Often times the basic dad knows which station has the lowest price in the area. 
            And has no issues with driving out of the way to a big box chain such as Costco or Sam’s Club, to fill up their vehicle.<br><br>
            8. The Superhero- The basic dad is often required to perform acts of minor “superhuman” strength. Such as
            opening tough jars.
            Or carrying in the most amount of grocery bags from the car, with the least number of trips. The basic dad
            also is fearless when it comes to scary jobs such as killing spiders in the house.
            Though these tasks may seem trivial, a basic dad is a minor level superhero to his
            family.<br><br>
            9. Chatty- Often times the basic dad is a friendly fellow. He is willing to chat with just about anyone.
            From cashiers at the store to people walking their dogs in the neighborhood; the basic dad is happy to say
            hello when he is out and about.
            He can small talk with the best of them, on just about anything, from politics to sports. Basic dads love
            superficial level socializing.<br><br>
            10. Advice- The basic dad knows (or thinks he knows) a little bit about almost everything. Often willing to
            dole out advice, whether wanted or not.
            A basic dad shares wisdom with others. And will pontificate about a variety of important issues. This may
            lead to long and somewhat boring stories of a time when he was younger.</h3>

        <h2>Ultimately, a basic dad is a man of character.
            He is a man of wisdom and experience. He is a man of discipline. He is dependable. He has a
            good heart. He wants to be a good citizen and neighbor. He may be somewhat embarrassing to his family but he
            loves his family and wants to be a role model for his kids. The basic dad wants the world in his own little sphere of influence, 
            to be a little bit better because of him. <br><br>
            He is a good man.</h2>
